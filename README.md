# Spotify Analyzer
### Mission
The goal of this project started with the discovery of a tutorial that showed how Spotify's API allows for OAuth login flow. 
I made a create-react-app in order to test out this authentification and realized there was a large amount of data accesible upon acquire access.
This is when a revelation came to me that I could visualize this data in a unique fashion that I did not see already in the "Community Section" of the Spotify developer page.

I knew that there was certain things in my own Spotify Data that I would to have visualized whenever I was curious.

    - What are my short term favorite artists and similarly my all-time favorite artists. Which Spotify does not showcase on their client-side applications.
    - I wanted to access ratios of genres I play and how "popular" my favorite artists are in the scheme of this digital streaming platform
    - Lastly I added another interest after discovering that Spotify routinely analyzes the sound files of songs and provides interpretted data of each.
        - This reveals super cool statistics on the songs "valence, tempo, signature, key, etc." which I might use later down the line in more sophisticated side-projects.

I also wanted to make this tool interactive such that recruiters and employers and get a taste of my own music style and compare it to their own, therefore a unique user can view my real-time data at any time! (Auth tokens are stored privtately on the backend environment variables)
